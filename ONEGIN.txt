  My uncle has most honest principles:
  When he was taken gravely ill,
  He forced one to respect him
  And nothing better could invent.
  To others his example is a lesson;
  But, good God, what a bore to sit
  By a sick person day and night, not stirring
  A step away!
  What base perfidiousness
  To entertain one half-alive,
  Adjust for him his pillows,
  Sadly serve him his medicine,
  Sigh â€” and think inwardly
  When will the devil take you?
